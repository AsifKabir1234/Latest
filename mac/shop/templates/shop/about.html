      <h1 class="display-3">Asif's Shop</h1>
      <p>Asif's Shop Pvt Ltd. is an Bangladesh electronic commerce company based in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Founded by Asif Kabir and Istihad Enan in 2023, the company initially focused on book sales, before expanding into other product categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, and lifestyle products.

The service competes primarily with Evaly subsidiary, and the domestic rival Snapdeal.[5][6] as of March 2023, Flipkart held a 39.5% market share of Bangladesh's e-commerce industry.[7] Flipkart is significantly dominant in the sale of apparel (a position that was bolstered by its acquisitions of Myntra and Jabong.com), and was described as being "neck and neck" with Evaly in the sale of electronics and mobile phones.[8] Flipkart also owns PhonePe, a mobile payments service based on the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

In June 2023, U.S.-based retail chain Walmart acquired a 77% controlling stake in Flipkart for US$16 billion, valuing it at $22 billion.</p>
